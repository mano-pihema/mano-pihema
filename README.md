## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me 

Kia ora! Welcome to my github page. I come from a background in cabinetry and prop making for film and TV. I'm a keen Full Stack Developer currently completing the Advanced Full Stack Developer at MissionReady focusing on integrating Cloud and AI services into my projects.

##  Iâ€™m currently working on 

My CV extractor [project](https://github.com/mano-pihema/cv-extract). It uses LlamaIndex RAG to query and extract data from a CV document. These extractions can be used to simplify profile creation on job board sites like TradeMe Jobs and Seek.
